- Select the project you just created, and go the "Create Service Account Key" page and in the 'Service Account' section click on 'New Service Account'.

- Enter the name & select the Role as 'Owner' for the project.

- Then click on create to have the JSON credentials file downloaded automatically.

- Add that json file in your laravel project root & add it to `.gitignore`.

- Set the path to that file as the value for the key `key_file_path` in the `config/googletranslate.php` (config file published by this package).
